# Cypress Installation Instructions

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to installing Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing framework. Cypress allows you to write tests for anything that runs in a browser.

## System Requirements

Before installing Cypress, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

* **Operating System:**

    * macOS 11 and above
    * Linux Ubuntu 20.04 and above, Fedora 40 and above, and Debian 11 and above
    * Windows 10 and above, Windows Server 2019, 2022 and 2025 (x64)
* **Node.js:** Cypress requires Node.js. It's recommended to use a Node.js version manager to easily switch between different Node.js versions. You can find installation instructions on the official Node.js website (<https://nodejs.org/>). (Note: The Node.js Snap for Linux is not recommended.)
* **Package Manager:** You will need a package manager such as npm, Yarn, or pnpm. This guide primarily uses npm.

## Installation Steps

There are two main ways to install Cypress:

### 1. Using npm (Recommended)

This is the recommended approach, as it simplifies version management and running Cypress in Continuous Integration (CI) environments.

1.  **Initialize your project:** If you haven't already, create a new project directory and initialize it with npm:

    ```
    mkdir my-cypress-project
    cd my-cypress-project
    npm init -y
    ```

2.  **Install Cypress:** Install Cypress as a development dependency in your project:

    ```
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

    This command installs Cypress locally within your project, in the `node_modules` directory. It also adds Cypress to your `package.json` file.

### 2. Direct Download (For Quick Trials)

This method provides a quick way to try out Cypress without installing any dependencies. However, it does not allow you to record your tests to the Cypress Dashboard.

1.  **Download Cypress:** Download the Cypress application directly from the official Cypress website: <https://www.cypress.io/>
2.  **Unzip:** Once the download is complete, unzip the file.
3.  **Run:** Double-click the unzipped application to start Cypress.

## Post-Installation

After installing Cypress, you can open it using the following command:

npx cypress open


This command will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can configure your project and run your tests.

## Project Setup

When you open Cypress for the first time, it will guide you through the setup process. Cypress will create a folder structure and some example files to help you get started.

Key files and directories:

* `cypress.config.js`: This is the main configuration file for Cypress, replacing the older `cypress.json`.
* `cypress/integration/`: This directory (or the directory specified by `e2e.specPattern` in your config) is where your end-to-end test files are located.
* `cypress/support/index.js`: This file is used to import any commands or setup that you want to run before each test file.
* `cypress/plugins/index.js`: This file is used to define any plugins you want to use with Cypress.

## Configuration

Cypress is configured via the `cypress.config.js` file. This file exports a configuration object using the `defineConfig` function.

Example `cypress.config.js`:
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress');

module.exports = defineConfig({
e2e: {
baseUrl: 'https://example.com',
specPattern: 'cypress/integration/**/*.cy.js',
supportFile: 'cypress/support/index.js',
setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
// You can add event listeners here
},
},
});


## Running Tests

To run your tests, you can use the following command:

* **Headless mode:**

    ```
    npx cypress run
    ```

    This runs Cypress tests in the command line, without opening a browser. This is typically used in CI environments.
* **Headed mode:**

    ```
    npx cypress open
    ```

    This opens the Cypress Test Runner in a browser, allowing you to see your tests execute.
